# Problems right now
1. Correcting a bug inside `ft_put` of `ft_str` function.
2. slow printing... I don't know how to solve this, i think i need to learn more about parsing maybe?
3. Not the best way to print "bases", a better way is to have a universal "base string" something like "0123456789abcdefghij..." that to transform to another bases is just a matter of the `tr(1)` command...
4. Unix philosophy ruining my whole project, i want something really minimal and modular, but i think that the architecture of this is ruining the whole idea of a simple and basic (printf)...
5. REWRITE IT... BETTER START NOW
