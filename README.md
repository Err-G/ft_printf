# ft_printf
## Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() aren’t enough.

### Description

`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the standard C library function `printf`. This project aims to provide a versatile and extensible printf function, allowing you to format and print output in a variety of ways. It is designed to be a more feature-rich alternative to `ft_putnbr()` and `ft_putstr()`.

### Roadmap

The following is a roadmap for implementing the features of `ft_printf`. Each feature corresponds to a specific format specifier:

Feature | Status
---|---
**%c: Print a Single Character** | ✅
**%s: Print a String** | ✅
**%p: Print a Pointer in Hexadecimal** | ✅
**%d: Print a Decimal Number** | ✅
**%i: Print an Integer in Base 10** | ✅
**%u: Print an Unsigned Decimal Number** | ✅
**%x: Print a Number in Hexadecimal (Lowercase)** | ✅
**%X: Print a Number in Hexadecimal (Uppercase)** | ✅
**%%: Print a Percent Sign** | ✅
