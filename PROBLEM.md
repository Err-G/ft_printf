# Problems right now
1. ~~Correcting a bug inside `ft_put` of `ft_str` function.~~
2. ~~slow printing... I don't know how to solve this, i think i need to learn more about parsing maybe?~~ (it was my computer... idk why)
3. Not the best way to print "bases", a better way is to have a universal "base string" something like "0123456789abcdefghij..." that to transform to another bases is just a matter of the `tr(1)` command...
4. ~~Unix philosophy ruining my whole project, i want something really minimal and modular, but i think that the architecture of this is ruining the whole idea of a simple and basic (printf)...~~ My dumbness is ruining everything because I want do something that work for every scenario, i'm not thinking about something that's really pratical...
5. REWRITE IT... BETTER START NOW (i did it... it's working, what is working i'm commiting and changing the original files)
